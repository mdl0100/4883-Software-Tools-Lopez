A08 - API - Covid Data

Create a RESTful API using FastAPI that provides access to COVID-19 data. 
The API will fetch the data from a publicly available data source and expose 
endpoints to retrieve various statistics related to COVID-19 cases.

The data source is a CSV file that contains COVID-19 data from 2020-2023.

If program gives error: Error loading ASGI app. Could not import module "api" 
    then run this command: uvicorn main:app --reload --port 5000

------------------------------------------------------------
#	Column	Description
0	Date_reported	date in yyyy-mm-dd format
1	Country_code	A unique 2 digit country code           (not used)
2	Country	Name of the country
3	WHO_region	World Health Organization region
4	New_cases	Number of new cases on this date
5	Cumulative_cases	Cumulative cases up to this date    (not used)
6	New_deaths	Number of new deaths on this date
7	Cumulative_deaths	Cumulative deaths up to this date   (not used)

Github Copilot was used to help write the comments in this file to keep them consistent 
between the API routes and between the functions.
