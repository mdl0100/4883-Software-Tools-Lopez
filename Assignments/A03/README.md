#### Why I chose Notion
I have used Notion for a few years for various organizational and productivity projects. 
I keep notes from classes, links for recipes, grocery lists, and full pdfs within Notion
that are each easily reachable through my PC, phone, or laptop. And all of it is on the 
free education plan. There are many tasks and processes in my life that I think could 
go much smoother if I was more proficient at using Notion, and discussing it in class
will most likely help me delve deeper into its capabilities.
