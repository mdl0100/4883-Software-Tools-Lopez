## A05 - Family Tree Data
### Marcos Lopez
### Description:

The purpose of this assignment is to produce a GraphViz family tree **programmatically**.
A Dwarven family tree is created with the following inheritance properties:
- Husbands take their wife's clan upon marriage.
- Children take their father's last name and paternal line clan.
  - This means that clan lines fall simliar to jewish faith through maternal lines.
  - You may have to back up a few generations to see what where a child received their clan from. 

### Files

|   #   | File | Description     |
| :---: | ---- | --------------- |
|   1   | [familyData](./familyData/)           | Folder with sample files provided by Dr.  Griffin    |
|   2   | [csv2json.dot](./csv2json.py)         | Makes [dwarf_family_tree.json](./dwarf_family_tree.json) using files in [familyData](./familyData/) |
|   3   | [dwarf_family_tree.json](./dwarf_family_tree.json) | Dwarf family tree data to be made into a graph using GraphViz |
|   4   | [family_tree.dot](./family_tree.dot)  | GraphViz File to make family tree                    |
|   5   | [family_tree.svg](./family_tree.svg)  | Picture file generated by online GraphViz tool | 
|   6   | [family.py](./family.py)              | Python file that converts [dwarf_family_tree](./dwarf_family_tree.json) into [family_tree.dot](./family_tree.dot) |

### Instructions
- Requires the following packages: graphviz (json and csv packages are already included in python)
- Open [family_tree.svg](./family_tree.svg) in a new tab for an easier viewing experience. 
- You will either need to use a vizualization package or an online GraphViz Editor such as [GraphViz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/)
- If you delete [dwarf_family_tree.json](./dwarf_family_tree.json), it can be regenerated by running [csv2json.py](./csv2json.py)
- If you delete either family_tree files, you can run [family.py](./family.py) to generate the .dot file and then upload it to the online tool.
